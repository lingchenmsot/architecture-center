# Choose the right technologies for Azure applications

When designing a solution for Azure, there are two technology choices that you should make early in the design process, because they affect the entire architecture. These are the choice of **compute** and **storage** technologies. 

- **Compute** refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. 

- **Storage** includes databases but also storage for message queues, caches, IoT data, unstructured log data, and anything else that an application might persist to storage.
